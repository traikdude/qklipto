📍 STARTING STATE
Project Context:
Implementing a local synchronization system for QKlipto Desktop to bypass cloud-only limitations.

📍 ACTION LOG

Action #1 | Implementation of Local Entry Point
- Created `debug-entry.js` to instrument the Electron app.
- Modified `package.json` to point to `debug-entry.js`.
- Rationale: Allowed modification of the closed-source/minified main process without direct binary editing.

Action #2 | Debugging Injection Race Conditions
- Issue: Toolbar missing or crashing.
- Discovery: Multiple zombie `electron.exe` processes were running old code.
- Fix: Force-terminated all zombie processes and implemented `browser-window-created` event hooks for reliable script injection.

Action #3 | Backend Sync Server
- Created `server.js` (Port 3000) to act as the local storage backbone.
- Rationale: Provides a standardized REST API for the injected toolbar to read/write JSON data.

Action #4 | Solving Navigation Blocks (will-navigate)
- Issue: `location.reload()` triggered an OS file associations popup ("Open with...").
- Discovery: Electron's security policy blocked renderer-side reloads as "navigations".
- Fix: Implemented IPC (Inter-Process Communication) channel `trigger-reload`. The renderer now sends a signal to the main process, which performs the reload securely.

📊 SESSION SUMMARY
- Created `debug-entry.js` (Main Process instrument)
- Created `server.js` (Local data bridge)
- Implemented IPC reload mechanism.
- Successfully imported "Welcome" note via local sync.

🔜 NEXT STEPS
- [ ] Populate `clipto-data.json` with user's actual notes.
- [ ] Test large data imports (>100 notes) for performance.
- [ ] Optional: Add automatic server startup to the Electron main process.
