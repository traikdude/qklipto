📍 STARTING STATE
Project Context:
The session evolved from modifying the legacy Clipto Desktop app (injecting local sync) to finalizing the new `qklipto-desktop` (Vite/React/Electron) Alpha.

📍 ACTION LOG (Part 2 - QKlipto Desktop)

Action #5 | React UI Restoration
- Resolved syntax errors in `src/pages/Settings.tsx` caused by redundant tags.
- Verified all components (ClipList, TagList, Settings) correctly reference the unified syncEngine.

Action #6 | Electron Main Process Fixes
- Issue: App failed to launch with "disableHardwareAcceleration" undefined.
- Fix: Updated `electron/main.ts` to use ESM imports instead of CommonJS `require`.
- Rationale: Fixed a module initialization mismatch caused by mixed CJS/ESM environments in the build pipeline.

Action #7 | Environment Clearing
- Issue: Legacy environmental variables (`ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE`) were forcing Electron into Node mode.
- Fix: Explicitly cleared the variable before launching, allowing the full Electron shell to initialize.

Action #8 | Production Alpha Build
- Executed `npm run electron:build` to generate the standalone `.exe` installer.
- Output: `qklipto-desktop/dist/win-unpacked/qklipto-desktop.exe`.

Action #9 | Desktop Integration
- Automatically updated the user's Desktop shortcut (`QKlipto.lnk`) via PowerShell, pointing it to the new working executable.

📊 SESSION SUMMARY
- Legacy app now has a Red/Blue local sync toolbar.
- New React app is Alpha-ready with a working shortcut.
- Hybrid Sync Engine (Firebase/Local) is wired and tested.

🔜 NEXT STEPS
- [ ] Implement automatic sync-on-launch for the React app.
- [ ] Add "Add Note" FAB (Floating Action Button) to the bottom right of the React app.
- [ ] Deploy the React app to Firebase Web Hosting (`deploy-web.ps1`).
