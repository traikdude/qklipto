### Planner Response

I see you're dealing with **12 Dependabot security alerts** in [scripts/CliptoDesktopSource/package.json](cci:7://file:///c:/Users/Erik/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/qklipto/scripts/CliptoDesktopSource/package.json:0:0-0:0). These are vulnerabilities in the extracted Clipto Desktop source code's npm dependencies.

Let me analyze the situation and propose a fix strategy:

*Viewed [package.json](file:///c:/Users/Erik/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/qklipto/scripts/CliptoDesktopSource/package.json) *

*Edited relevant file*

*Edited relevant file*

### User Input

Option A (Recommended): Dismiss alerts in GitHub UI — this is analysis-only code, not production.

*Edited relevant file*

### Planner Response

The browser tool encountered an issue. No problem — I can use the GitHub CLI (`gh`) to dismiss these alerts programmatically instead.

*User accepted the command `gh api /repos/traikdude/qklipto/dependabot/alerts --jq '.[].number'`*

*Checked command status*

### Planner Response

I've identified all 12 alerts (IDs 1-12). Now I'll dismiss them using the GitHub API with the reason "This code is used for analysis and is not in production."

*User accepted the command `1..12 | ForEach-Object { gh api --method PATCH "/repos/traikdude/qklipto/dependabot/alerts/$_" -f state=dismissed -f dismissed_reason=tolerable_risk -f dismissed_comment="Legacy analysis-only code, not in production" }`*
