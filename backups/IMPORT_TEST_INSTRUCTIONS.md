# 📥 STEP 2: Import Sample JSON (Test)

## Quick Check First:

**Can you see your backup file on the device?**
- Open **Files** app → **Downloads** folder
- Look for a file like: `clipto_backup_2026-01-23.json`
- **What's the exact filename?**

I'm having trouble finding it via ADB, but that's okay! As long as YOU can see it in your Downloads folder, we're safe to proceed.

## Now: Import the Sample JSON

### On Your Android Device:

1. **Open Clipto app**

2. **Go to Import**:
   - Tap **☰ Menu** or **⋮ Three Dots**
   - **Settings** → **Backup & Restore**
   - Select **Import** / **Restore from File**

3. **Select the SAMPLE file**:
   - Navigate to **Download** folder
   - **IMPORTANT**: Choose **`sample-clipto-export.json`** (NOT your backup!)
   - The sample file has 4 test clips

4. **Confirm Import**

## After Import - CHECK IMMEDIATELY:

### Critical Verification:
- [ ] **Your existing notes still there?** ✅ or ❌
- [ ] **4 new clips appeared?** (Welcome Message, GitHub Repository, Migration Checklist, Build Success)
- [ ] **Tags showing on clips?**

**Tell me right away**:
- "Success - existing notes safe + 4 new clips added" ✅
- OR
- "Problem - my notes disappeared!" ❌ (we'll restore from backup)
