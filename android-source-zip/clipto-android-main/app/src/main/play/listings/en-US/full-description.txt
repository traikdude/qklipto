Clipto is a new way to organize your daily work with important or temporary notes, snippets, clipboard history and files when you need to do it quickly, conveniently and reliably.


SYNC WITH MAC, WINDOWS, LINUX AND BROWSER
Try Clipto on the web and download the desktop apps from our site https://clipto.pro.
Clipto keeps everything in sync.


WORK OFFLINE
Each action works completely offline. If you want your notes to be synced across all your devices, just sign in with the same account. If not, just do not sign in and use manual import/export capabilities. It is fully up to you.


TAKE NOTES FROM CLIPBOARD
Clipto can be used as a clipboard manager even on Android 10!


ACTIVATE UNIVERSAL CLIPBOARD
With Universal Clipboard, you can copy notes on one device, then paste the content on another.


SCAN BARCODES
Clipto lets use your Camera to capture notes and save it into the app.
On-device Barcode Scanning reads most standard formats (Codabar, Code 39, Code 93, Code 128, EAN-8, EAN-13, ITF, UPC-A, UPC-E, Aztec, Data Matrix, PDF417, QR Code).


ADD FILES
In Clipto you can store any files (not only images or photos)

Once installed Clipto allows you to customize any smallest behavior according to your needs:
• Theme (White, Sepia, Green, Dark, Dark Blue, Dark Blurple, AMOLED Black)
